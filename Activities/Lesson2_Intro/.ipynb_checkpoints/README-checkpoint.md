## HELLO!
I'm Coney. My friends call me "Coneychiwa!", which means "Hello!" in Japanese. I am currently working as a Payroll Coordinator in one of Canada's top restaurant and hospitality companies. 


## My Experience
I have been working in financial services for a little over a decade. I have experience in the following industries:
- corporate governance
- executive compensation advisory
- insurance
- payroll

## My Goals
I aspire to be a Certified Compensation Professional. With the soaring of FinTech globally, it would be an advantage for my career to learn and have solid fundamentals of FinTech to broaden my knowledge on how to create and utilize new technologies to enhance processes and add more value to research and analysis.
