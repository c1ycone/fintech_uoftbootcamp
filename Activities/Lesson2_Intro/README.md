# PAYROLL & FINTECH 
Big data from financial services and human resources have formed large galaxies of businesses that are distinct from each other. The amalgamation of data from these two industries with the significant influence of technology have led payroll services to be part of Human Resource Integrated Systems (HRIS) with such vast business opportunities of offering tools, solutions, and services to store, merge, process, and analyze these valuable and sensitive data to businesses of all sizes globally. 

Even with the growing ease of starting small and home-based businesses, the demand for payroll services goes beyond accurate calculations, timely payments, and employer remittances. Payroll is now expected to, at a minimum, offer analytics for critical daily decision-making and future business planning with the assurance of continued compliance to government laws and company policies. Cloud-based platforms are now very common in payroll when it was unthinkable a decade ago to have paperless payroll processing and recordkeeping. Furthermore, the application of blockchain technology will highly disrupt the entire financial industry that it poses a big challenge to payroll in adopting the oxymoron of technological decentralization which is to heighten efficiency, promote connectivity, and strengthen security by breaking its walls of privacy and confidentiality regardless whether in a private or public blockchain environment.

With the overwhelming business opportunities, how will payroll companies use their valuable data and how will they position their services in the FinTech universe?

# BUSINESS CHALLENGE AND ADVANTAGE

Humi, emerging from being a new startup in 2016, claims to be an “all-in-one HR solution for Canadian businesses” when it currently highlights to support only payroll and employee benefits among the many various areas in cloud-based HRIS. It was also clarified in their website that Humi doesn't downside since this is a basic feature that payroll professionals are looking for in choosing HRIS platforms. Although, being in its early stage, Humi still has a promising room for growth in scalability and product base. Hopefully, integrating time and attendance in their platform is a priority in their future developments. 

The agility of startup companies has been one of their key advantages over formidable global payroll service providers, which fuels them to pursue the significant shift towards the bold evolution of payroll to its polar opposite - instantaneous and universal payments, pay transparency, and highly cost-efficient. 


# RECOMMENDATIONS

#### Business Intelligence and Analytics

Since labour costs, which includes salaries, wages, benefits, allowances, and payroll-related taxes, is among the top expenses of the company, the responsibility of watching over labour cost should only be a task of the Finance Department but must shared among other departments such as HR, Payroll, Business Operations, Legal, and IT. Thus, the need to place high importance in creating tools and services in reporting and analytics. 


#### Solution focused: One-Hub Business

To be full-fleged one-stop shop HRIS, these features and services should be considered to be part  of “nice-to-have” list. Most of these are already being offered by different companies either as part of their platform or a stand-alone service. 

- Offer daily pay feature (DailyPay - US) versus the usual pay schedule frequencies: weekly, bi-weekly, bi-monthly, monthly, quarterly, and annually.

- Offer more industry-specific customizations
Features such as Time and Attendance and Scheduling have a huge space for improvement as its functions differ in various industries. For example, shifts in retail and hospitality demand more flexibility in terms of employee availability, different work assignments with different pay rates, and overtime. Comparing it to a more rigid work schedule in manufacturing. 

- Integrating with other lines of business:

**HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT** 
- Community involvement and volunteer program
- Charity donations (Benevity)
-  Wellness programs

**BUSINESS OPERATIONS** 
- Business continuity planning - expansion of demand prediction
-  Treasury management - full integration for on-demand forecasting and budgeting

**BANKING** 
- Savings and investment
-  Early payroll ending (KOHO)
- Financial planning
-  Insurance

Even the major payroll vendors have not incorporated these tools and services in their platforms to be the ultimate Swiss-army knife in payroll. Whether payroll companies choose to concentrate on one of the two recommendations or pursue to become ultimate mammoths in the industry, utilizing fintech infrastructures gives these companies the advantage of equipping businesses to focus more on its operations and implement strategies.
